# ArduSim usage

We already explained that ArduSim can be used in two was. First, it can be used to develop a new protocol, simulating the UAVs behavior for debugging until the protocol is ready to be deployed. Second, it can be used to deploy the new protocol in real multicopters, and playing two roles, as an *UAV agent* and as a *PC Companion* that helps to control de deployment from a laptop. This section explains in detail how to use ArduSim for simulation and for the deployment in real multicopters.

## 1 ArduSim on simulation

A simulation can be performed directly in Eclipse or from a *.jar* executable file. You need to run ArduSim with the parameter *-c false* to avoid it to run as a PC Companion. If you run ArduSim from Eclipse IDE you will need to set the parameter in the "run configuration".

We suggest to run ArduSim as Administrator (Windows, requires Imdisk Virtual Disk Driver) or sudoer (Linux). In this mode, temporary files are stored in a virtual hard drive, which speeds up ArduSim when using a slow HHDD, as it could limit the number of virtual multicopters that can be run simultaneously.

### 1.1 Simulation configuration

ArduSim starts showing the following dialog:

![ArduSim configuration dialog](config.png)

This dialog allows to introduce several simulation parameters:

* Simulation parameters:

    * *ArduCopter path*. The arducopter executable file is auto-detected if found in the same folder as ArduSim. In any other case, you need to manually locate the file.
    * *Speeds file*. The user must provide a *.csv* file with the maximum desired speed for the UAVs. One value per line must be provided for each multicopter.
    * *Number of UAVs*. The user can select the number of multicopters to be simulated depending on the number of speed values in the previous file, and the performance of the computer.

* Performance parameters:

    * *Screen refresh rate*. The UAVs and the path they are following are drawn on screen to analyze the behavior of the protocol under development. When running a large number of virtual UAVs, if the screen is updated frequently the performance of ArduSim can be affected.
    * *Minimum screen redraw distance*. Each time the multicopter moves on the screen a new line is also drawn between the previous and the current location of the UAV. The greater the number of lines to draw is, the CPU usage increases, so increasing the length of the lines we reduce the CPU usage.
    * *Enable arducopter logging*. The firmware of the virtual flight controller can provide a binary log file that can be analyzed with tools like APM Planner 2.
    * *Restrict battery capacity*. By default, the battery capacity is almost infinite. The user can set a normal battery capacity to analyze the energy consumption produced by the protocol.
    * *Measure CPU usage*. If the behavior of the protocol is not the expected, and it includes complex calculus, it is possible that the CPU usage is too high to simulate a large amount of multicopters. Checking this option allows to log the CPU usage to a file for further analysis.
    * *Rendering quality*. Four rendering quality levels have been analyzed in a [journal article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2018.06.009) about ArduSim, showing that they can be categorized in two groups attending the impact on the system performance. The levels *Maximum performance* and *Text smoothed* have lower impact than *Text and lines smoothed* and *Maximum quality*.

* General parameters:

    * *Enable verbose logging*. The user may use this option to show additional information in the main window log and console, only under certain circumstances.
    * *Enable verbose storage*. Similar to the previous option, the user may store additional information related to the protocol in files, only in some cases.

* UAV synchronization protocol. This list is automatically populated with the protocols implemented in ArduSim. The user must select the protocol to be tested in simulation.

* UAV to UAV communications parameters:

    * *Enable carrier sensing*. When checked, this option forces to verify if the virtual media is busy before sending a new data packet.
    * *Enable packet collision detection*. Messages are discarded if this option is active and several are received at the same time on destination. 
    * *Receiving buffer size*. The default value is the receiving buffer size in Raspbian in a Raspberry Pi 3.
    * *Wireless communications model*. Three propagation models have been implemented until now. *unrestricted* model allows data packets to arrive to destination always. *fixed range* model delivers packets only to UAVs that are at a distance lower than a certain threshold. Finally, *802.11a with 5dBi antenna* model has been implemented considering the communication link quality between two real multicopters (realistic model).
    * *Fixed range distance*. If the second model is used, this option sets the range distance.

* UAV Collision detection parameters:

    * *Enable collision detection*. During simulation, ArduSim can check if two UAVs collide during the experiment.
    * *Check period*. It sets the period between two checks.
    * *Distance threshold*. This is the maximum distance between two virtual multicopters to assert that a collision has happened.
    * *Altitude difference threshold*. Similar to the previous option, this is the maximum altitude height difference to assert that a collision has happened.

* Wind parameters:

    * *Enable wind*. Uniform wind can be simulated.
    * *Direction*. This parameter sets the direction of the wind in degrees.
    * *Speed*. This parameter sets the wind speed (m/s).

### 1.2 Protocol configuration

If the developer chooses to implement a dialog to input protocol parameters, it would open once the general configuration options are accepted. Otherwise, the main window of ArduSim is opened.

This is the right place to set protocol parameters, and to load missions if needed by the protocol.

### 1.3 Main window

The following picture shows the main window of ArduSim.

ArduSim can be executed with the following command line:

    java -jar ArduSim.jar -c <arg> [-r <arg> [-p <arg> -s <arg>]] [-h]

... diferentiate three roles as explained in the previous section
