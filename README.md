# ArduSim

ArduSim is a novel real-time flight simulator, oriented to the development of communications and flight coordination protocols among multicopters, performing planned missions or forming a swarm. It is able to simulate up to 256 UAVs (aka. drones) simultaneously, if the hardware meets the recommended requirements, and the TCP and UDP ports needed by SITL are free. Among many information, ArduSim generates the path followed by each UAV in OMNeT++ and NS2 format to provide mobility traces, performing a simulation or even when running ArduSim in a real multicopter.

The Communication with multicopters uses the MAVLink protocol, a *de facto* standard for current open flight controllers, which makes the deployment of a new protocol on real UAVs a trivial task.

The communication among multicopters emulates an Ad-hoc WiFi network link in the 5 GHz frequency band, where all the data packets are broadcasted. ArduSim is prepared to include new wireless models in future versions.

Ardusim was developed by [Francisco Fabra](mailto:frafabco@cam.upv.es), Phd student in the [Grupo de Redes de Computadores (GRC)](http://www.grc.upv.es/) research group of [Departamento de Informática de Sistemas y Computadores (DISCA)](http://www.upv.es/entidades/DISCA/index-es.html) department of [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/) university. Supervisor: [Carlos T. Calafate](http://www.grc.upv.es/calafate/).

As an example of the capabilities of ArduSim, the next picture shows 72 multicopters following elliptical missions like electrons of an atom.

## Citation

The article *[ArduSim: Accurate and real-time multicopter simulation](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.simpat.2018.06.009)* was published in the journal [Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory (SIMPAT)](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/simulation-modelling-practice-and-theory) detailing most characteristics of ArduSim and validating its performance. Since then, many improvements have been made, including traces output in OMNeT++ and NS2 format.
